Easy-Dates
==========

The focus of this class is to extend the built in PHP dateTime class BUT to add a more expressive approach to calling or setting the date and time. I've also added a new method that returns the amount of time since the event happened - Twitter / Facebook style. This is quite a common format now so thought it would be nice to have easy access to this in the future.
